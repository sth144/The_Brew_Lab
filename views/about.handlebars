    <p>My name is Sean Hinds. I'm a scientist and software developer living in Madison, WI. I graduated with a Bachelors of Science in Biochemistry from the University of Wisconsin Madison in 2015. I have since worked as a scientist, first in a government lab, and now in industry. My biotechnology experience ranges from molecular separations to bioinformatics.</p>
    <p>While much of my academic background is in the life sciences, I do have a substantial software development background. I've taken coursework in object oriented programming in C++, data structures in C, discrete structures in computer science, computer architecture, assembly language, algorithms in Python, and web development in JavaScript/Node.js. I am familiar with developing GUI applications in Java for multiple platforms, and C# for Windows systems. I also enjoy exploring the software-hardware interface with my Arduino.</p>
    <p>I made this site using Node.js, AngularJS, and Bootstrap. I used Node Express Handlebars to serve html templates. The "Resources" page makes an AJAX request to the Youtube iframe API. I deployed this site on Heroku.</p>
    <p>When I'm not pipetting, sifting through data, or coding, I'm rock climbing, cycling, or cooking. I am also an avid homebrewer (if you couldn't tell). Reach out to me via the contact page if you have any questions, or if you want to work with me. </p>
