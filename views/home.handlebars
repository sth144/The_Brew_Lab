        <p>Beer is by far the most widely consumed alcoholic beverage on earth. Many people enjoy exploring the diversity of beer styles which can famously be produced from the same four ingredients. How is this possible? Some people become interested in this question, and are drawn to the hobby of homebrewing. These people will eventually discover, one way or another, that without an adequate understanding of the molecular and physical transformations involved in the brewing process, they cannot device recipes and processes which yield the desired product.</p>
        <p>Science and brewing share a highly intertwined history. The modern sciences of biochemistry and microbiology can largely trace their origins to the brewing industry of the 19th century. Today, brewing borrows heavily from the fields of bioanalytical chemistry and chemical engineering. There is no way to separate beer from the science that underpins it. Homebrewers should seek to understand fermentation science so that they might produce better quality product, and gain a heightened appreciation for their craft.</p>                        
        <p>This web app serves two purposes. First, as a resource for homebrewers interested in delving further into the science of homebrewing. Second, as a resource for scientists interested in picking up the hobby. To the homebrewers I would say: don't be intimidated by scientific jargon. If you see a term you don't know just read it's intro on wikipedia, and not a word further--especially if you start seeing math symbols. To the scientists: homebrewing is not terribly difficult or expensive to pick up, just don't be afraid to fail a couple of times. Please reach out to me via the contact page if you have any questions!</p>
